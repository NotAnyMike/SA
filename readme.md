# Sentiment Analysis Project

Here will be located the respository for the Sentiment Analysis project for the CL UTL.

## General information

This project will use MongoDB as a database, in order to run it run `mongod --dbpath docs/db`

## Useful commands

* Don't forget to do `source sa/bin/activate` and `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
* I recommend to have the MongoDB installed not only through pip, but also through the binary or brew
* In order to use `networkx` it is necesary to have installed `GDAL` if it rises an error taying to install it use a speacial version for instance `pip install GDAL==1.10.0`
